# Antimicrobial_peptides

### Description
Small peptides could have an influence on the bacterial fitness. One possible source of peptides is the bacterium itself. By taking advantage of high throughput DNA sequencing technologies and computational analytic tools, we are able to identify nucleotide patterns which could kill the bacteria or benefit it. We then use the machine learning method to predict the effect of a given DNA sequences and use in-lab evolution to determine the mechanism by which they kill or benifit.
